# Sorting-Visualizer
This project visualizes various sorting algorithms using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The Sorting Visualiser is a web application that allows users to visualize different sorting algorithms. It is an educational tool designed to help understand how sorting algorithms work by providing an interactive and visual representation.
# Project Overview:
Developed a dynamic and interactive web application that visualizes various sorting algorithms. The project is designed to help users understand and observe the inner workings of sorting algorithms through real-time visual feedback.
# Key Features:
# Algorithm Implementation:
Implemented multiple sorting algorithms, including:
# Bubble Sort:
A simple comparison-based algorithm where adjacent elements are swapped if they are in the wrong order, with each pass through the list pushing the largest unsorted element to its final position.
# Merge Sort:
A divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits the array into smaller sub-arrays, sorts them, and then merges them back together in the correct order.
# Quick Sort:
An efficient algorithm that picks a pivot element, partitions the array around the pivot, and recursively sorts the sub-arrays.
# Selection Sort:
Selection Sort is a straightforward comparison-based sorting algorithm. The idea is to divide the array into a sorted and an unsorted part.
# Insertion Sort:
The algorithm iterates over the array, repeatedly picking the next element and inserting it into its correct position among the previously sorted elements.
# Dynamic Visualization:
Created a visual representation of the sorting process, where users can see the elements being sorted in real-time. The visualizer highlights the elements being compared, swapped, or merged, providing an educational tool for understanding these algorithms.
# User Interface Design:
Designed an intuitive and responsive user interface using HTML5 and CSS3. The interface allows users to:
Select different sorting algorithms.

Adjust the speed of the visualization.

Change the size of the array to be sorted.

Start, pause, and reset the sorting process at any time.

Educational Value: This project serves as a practical tool for students and individuals interested in learning about sorting algorithms. The real-time visualization and ability to interact with the sorting process help to demystify complex algorithmic concepts, making them easier to grasp.

# Challenges Overcome:
Optimized the performance of the visualization to handle larger datasets without significant lag, ensuring smooth animations and user experience.

Balanced the design of the user interface to be both informative and visually appealing while maintaining simplicity and ease of use.

# Outcome:
Successfully created a Sorting Visualizer that not only showcases technical proficiency in JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3 but also provides an educational platform for understanding sorting algorithms. This project demonstrates the ability to translate complex algorithmic logic into an accessible and interactive learning tool.
